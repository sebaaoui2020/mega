In fact, you can pass the level in fewer steps without touching the switch. First, let the little girl enter the yellow light, and switch to let the ghost reach the other yellow light. At the place, purple light and green fog appeared. "

With the first tape you encounter immediately off-setting the atmosphere with an eerie sense of being watched, the owners inform you that they know you're watching the pre-recorded video. There is a great sense of paranoia that never leaves you and only until the latter half of the game does this paranoia become validated. "
